ðŸ“šStep-by-Step Walkthrough:

1. Initially, the result list is empty.

2. We start with the initial call to the backtrack function with start = 0 and path = [].

3. Inside the backtrack function:
- We add the current path (empty list) to the result. So, result = [[]].
- We iterate over the elements of nums starting from index start = 0.
   
4. For the first element 1:
- We add 1 to the path, so path = [1].
- We make a recursive call to backtrack(1, [1]).

5. Inside the recursive call with start = 1 and path = [1]:
- We add the current path [1] to the result. So, result = [[], [1]].
- We iterate over the elements of nums starting from index start = 1.

6. For the second element 2:
- We add 2 to the path, so path = [1, 2].
- We make a recursive call to backtrack(2, [1, 2]).

7. Inside the recursive call with start = 2 and path = [1, 2]:
- We add the current path [1, 2] to the result. So, result = [[], [1], [1, 2]].
- We iterate over the elements of nums starting from index start = 2.

8. For the third element 3:
- We add 3 to the path, so path = [1, 2, 3].
- We make a recursive call to backtrack(3, [1, 2, 3]).

9. Inside the recursive call with start = 3 and path = [1, 2, 3]:
- We add the current path [1, 2, 3] to the result. So, result = [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]].
- Since start = 3 equals the length of nums, we return from this recursive call.

10. After returning from the recursive call with start = 2, we remove the last element from path, so path = [1, 2].
11. We move to the next iteration for nums[2] (which is 3).
12. We repeat the same steps for nums[2] = 3, and after the recursive call returns, we remove the last element from path again.
13. We return from the initial call to backtrack with start = 1, so path = [1].
14. We move to the next iteration for nums[1] (which is 2).
15. We repeat the same steps, and after the recursive call returns, we remove the last element from path.
16. We return from the initial call to backtrack with start = 0, so path = [].
17. We have iterated through all elements of nums, and the process is complete.
18. At the end, result contains all the subsets of [1, 2, 3], including the empty subset, which is [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]].
