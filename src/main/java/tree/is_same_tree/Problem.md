### 100. Same Tree
_Easy_

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

```text
Example 1
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

```text
Example 2
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```
